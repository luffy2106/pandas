# just-pandas-things
This repo contains a few peculiar things I've learned about pandas that have made my life easier and my code faster. This post isn't a friendly tutorial for beginners, but a friendly introduction to pandas weirdness.


## What's in this repo?

1. pandas is column-major, which is why row-based operations are slow
2. `SettingWithCopyWarning`, or why we can't have nice things
3. Indexing and slicing
4. Accessors
5. Data exploration
6. Common pitfalls


## Practice pandas

The exercices in each notebook is take from this resources:
